# Temperature-Controlled-Fan-System

Overview
This project involves designing a temperature-controlled fan system using an ATmega32 microcontroller. The fan is automatically turned on or off based on the temperature, as sensed by an LM35 temperature sensor.

System Requirements
Microcontroller: ATmega16 running at 1 MHz.
Temperature Sensor: LM35, providing continuous analog output corresponding to the temperature.
Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC): Converts the analog output of the LM35 to a digital value.
Temperature Display: The temperature is displayed on an LCD.
Fan Control Logic:
Temperature < 30°C: Fan off
Temperature ≥ 30°C: Fan at 25% speed
Temperature ≥ 60°C: Fan at 50% speed
Temperature ≥ 90°C: Fan at 75% speed
Temperature ≥ 120°C: Fan at 100% speed
Fan Control Mechanism: A DC motor, controlled using PWM signals generated by Timer0.
Fan State Display: The LCD continuously displays the temperature value and fan state.

Project Architecture
The project is designed and implemented based on a layered architecture model. This ensures modularity and separation of concerns.

Layers:
Application Layer: Main logic for temperature monitoring and fan control.
MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer): ADC, GPIO, PWM drivers.
HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer): LCD, Temperature Sensor, DC Motor drivers.
